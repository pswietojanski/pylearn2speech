All of pylearn2's dependencies (theano / scipy / numpy / etc.) make reproducibility
very difficult. As such, we are not currently going to make any effort to ensure that
all results are widely reproducible on a variety of platforms. Instead, we will
record the platform on which they were verified to be correct.
