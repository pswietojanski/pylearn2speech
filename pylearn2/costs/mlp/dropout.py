    This paper suggests including each unit with probability p during training,
    then multiplying the outgoing weights by p at the end of training.
    We instead include each unit with probability p and divide its
    state by p during training. Note that this means the initial weights should
    be multiplied by p relative to Hinton's.
    The SGD learning rate on the weights should also be scaled by p^2 (use
    W_lr_scale rather than adjusting the global learning rate, because the
    learning rate on the biases should not be adjusted).
