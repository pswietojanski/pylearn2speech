PYLEARN2_VIEWER_COMMAND not defined. PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE CAREFULLY
TO SET UP THIS ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE:

pylearn2 uses an external program to display images. Because different systems have different
image programs available, pylearn2 requires the user to specify what image viewer program to
use.

You need to choose an image viewer program that pylearn2 should use. Then tell pylearn2 to use
that image viewer program by defining your PYLEARN2_VIEWER_COMMAND environment variable.

You need to choose PYLEARN_VIEWER_COMMAND such that running

${PYLEARN2_VIEWER_COMMAND} image.png

in a command prompt on your machine will do the following:
    -open an image viewer in a new process.
    -not return until you have closed the image.

Acceptable commands include:
    gwenview
    eog --new-instance

This is assuming that you have gwenview or a version of eog that supports --new-instance
installed on your machine. If you don't, install one of those, or figure out a command
that has the above properties that is available from your setup.

On most linux setups, you can define your environment variable by adding this line to your
~/.bashrc file:

export PYLEARN2_VIEWER_COMMAND="eog --new-instance"

*** YOU MUST INCLUDE THE WORD "export". DO NOT JUST ASSIGN TO THE ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE ***
If you do not include the word "export", the environment variable will be set in your
bash shell, but will not be visible to processes that you launch from it, like the python
interpreter.

Don't forget that changes from your .bashrc file won't apply until you run

source ~/.bashrc

or open a new terminal window. If you're seeing this from an ipython notebook
you'll need to restart the ipython notebook, or maybe modify os.environ from
an ipython cell.
