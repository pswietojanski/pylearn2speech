# pylearn2speech

Note this is really pylearn2 which I cloned long time ago
 and since diverged a lot from the official version. 

This should be a branch, not a separate repository, 
but due to timings of this clone and the time I made a fork,
a copy like this is the easiest way for me to follow. 
I am merging my contributions back to the official trunk, 
but in the meantime, for the sake of reproducibility of
 the results I have published to date, I made this copy 
of my local version publicitly available.
